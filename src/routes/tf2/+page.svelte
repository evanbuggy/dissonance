<h1>TF2 Server</h1>

<p>
    This is my official Team Fortress 2 server,
    which is focused on very strange maps and 
    vanilla map edits. However, it is still 
    specifically a server for playing casual 
    games on. It's not an idle or trade server. 
    It's my best attempt to try and provide a 
    fresh way of playing one of my favourite 
    games.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, there is only 1 server situated in
    Finland (EU-central). If there is demand for
    US servers and player interest continues, I
    will have no problem in setting up more.
</p>

<p>
    Follow this page for map updates and patch notes
    regarding the server! And as a reminder, it costs
    money to keep the server up and running. If you like
    playing on it and are willing to help, I highly suggest
    donating with the big button on the bottom of the page.
    It's entirely optional and it does not currently give you
    any benefits.
