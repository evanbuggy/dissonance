# dissonance.fun
This is the source code for my old portfolio web app. Since I took it offline, you can run it locally yourself (If you are just that curious, for whatever reason).

This website was made using [Sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction).

## Building
1. `npm run build`
2. `node build`

## Docker
You can pull the image from Docker Hub with `docker pull buggyy/dissonance:nodeserver`.
You can compose your own image with `docker compose up`.
